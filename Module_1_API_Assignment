# Module 1 API Assignment

An Application Programming Interface (API) would be extremely useful in supporting the school’s business operations. 
To describe how an API would be useful, it is important to understand what an API is and does. 
In the simplest terms, an API can be thought of as the “messenger” between the user (client) and the system (server). 
The client sends a request, which is carried by the API to the server. The system then returns the results through the API back to the client. 
When considering an API for this project, a REST API would be most useful. 
This is because the school management system is web-based and REST API’s can be used over almost any protocol, especially HTTP. 
REST API’s are also very flexible as it can handle multiple types of calls and return data in different formats. 
It is likely that with a school system such as this, there can be the expectation of multiple requests from students (clients) to the school system (server) and 
to accommodate these requests, a REST API would be recommended. It will also be likely that the school will use multiple learning management systems for course management. 
An API in this case would be highly efficient to carry out and return data from these systems.
